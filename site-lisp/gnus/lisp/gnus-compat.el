;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines and redefines a bunch of functions for Gnus
;; usage.  The basic (and somewhat unsound) idea is to make all
;; Emacsen look like the current trunk of Emacs.  So it will define
;; functions "missing" in other Emacs instances, and redefine other
;; functions to work like the Emacs trunk versions.
